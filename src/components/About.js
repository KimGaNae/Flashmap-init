            <p>Hi! Curious Reader. We are Kevin Kim and Steve Kim. We decided to make this website as a fun 3-day project. Kevin in charge of the front-end and Steve in charge of the back-end.
            </p>
            <p>We hope you had fun on our website using relational flashcards. Flashcards that were not just about memorization but about knowing a subject through relationships, because we believe that relationships of knowledge points is how we think we learn.</p>
